# eTe-analysis

This is the Assessment Task II Project by UTS MDSI students in Spring 2020

Project Title: Collaborative Development of an end to end project using Centralized Code Repositories + Github usage analysis and reflection of the project

# The file structure is 

/etl - for Extract, Transform, Load processing

/analysis - for code of EDA and insights

             /analysis/question_1 - for  each research question
             /analysis/question_2
             /analysis/question_3
             
             
 # Data

 # How to start ?
 - Fork this repository to your personal remote repository(account)
 
     This will be your own remote repo to which you commit your local changes and 
     from which (browser interface) your pull request will be made.
 
 - In your local machine, create local repository, 
    in your preferred workspace,
    
      git init
      
 - Connect to your personal remote repo from your local repo
 
      git remote add origin master https://github.com/<yourname>/eTe-analysis.git
 
 - Clone your remote repo into your local machine
 
      git pull origin master 
      
  Then every thing is ready.
  
  So there are altogether three stages of repository.
  
  local repo --> personal remote repo --> master central remote repo
 
 
 # General Rule of Thumb in Creating Tasks, Assigining Tasks and Making Pull Requests
 
- Use "issues" tab to register the tasks to which member(s) are assigned or your favourite tasks assigned to yourself
- State Issue Id  "#xx" in the pull request name / title/ message to allow the teams knows that what your Pull request is about and to which task(issue) it is for

# How to keep your local repository updated everyday? Important!!!!

- Make sure you commit your local changes first
- Always make git pull before starting your work of the day in your local directory/repo
